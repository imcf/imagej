	 * We want a dependency graph of measures. We want to be able to delete a
	 * measure from graph and kill all dependent measures as well. We want to
	 * resolve portions of the graph simultaneously maybe to save data space
	 * traversals. We want to reset measures to NaNs when certain data events
	 * happen. We want data objects to associated with more than one measure.
	 * So we could update a Dataset and have the mean of the Dataset and the mean
	 * of a neighborhood of the Dataset both be reset or recalced. We want to
	 * build measures out of simpler measures. So at constructor time so user can
	 * provide options if necessary. These options can be part of the dependency
	 * graph even if desired (maybe but maybe not). We want inputs and outputs to
	 * be arbitrary objects. For instance a measure could be a Double or a
	 * PointSet (such as the convex hull) or a String or anything else. And
	 * another measure might use the convex hull as an input for its computation.
